# Flask-Bootstrap configurable webiste
Combination of Flask and Bootstarp is good fit for making websites with full capable extension possibilites, due
to vast range of python abilities. User friendly blueprint of Flask and its power of templating makes it very good choice for web 
development. On the other hand bootstrap is a definate choice for front end in case you dont want to spend too much time on front end.
* Bootstarp is used for most of the front end, its fully responsive. 
* Flask webframework is used to keep our project lightweighted and dont add unwanted dependancies.  
* Flask provide very optimize way to handle templates using JINJA templating. In case application has many webpges its always good to 
  use JINJA, I have used it in this project. It reduces lot of repetaion of code and helps to keep front end code clean.
